"""Sentence-level cleaning for the ``sanitized`` copy.

Within a high-risk field, replace each contiguous run of high-scoring sentences
with a marker and keep the rest, so a mid-content cut stays visible to consumers
that read only ``sanitized``. Best-effort only (capped by detection) — callers
still gate on ``allowed``. Runs after Tier 2 so per-sentence scores are available.
